              <h1 class="main-heading">Planet Plate</h1>
              <p>We developed a food waste management app that addresses the issue of surplus groceries and vegetables by providing a platform for individuals and organizations to sell them at reduced prices. This approach ensures that excess food items are utilized before they spoil, benefiting both sellers and buyers. By connecting surplus food with those in need, our app promotes sustainability and reduces food waste while providing affordable options for consumers.</p>
